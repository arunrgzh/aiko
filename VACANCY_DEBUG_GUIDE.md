# Vacancy Recommendations Debug Guide

## Issue Analysis

The user was getting 0 job recommendations despite having completed onboarding with skills like:

-   –í–∏–¥–µ–æ–º–æ–Ω—Ç–∞–∂ (Video editing)
-   –ì—Ä–∞—Ñ–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π –¥–∏–∑–∞–π–Ω (Graphic design)
-   SMM
-   –ö–æ–ø–∏—Ä–∞–π—Ç–∏–Ω–≥ (Copywriting)
-   –ö–æ–º–º—É–Ω–∏–∫–∞—Ü–∏–∏ (Communications)
-   –¢–µ–ª–µ–º–∞—Ä–∫–µ—Ç–∏–Ω–≥ (Telemarketing)

## Root Cause Found

The main issue was that the user's profession was set to "–±–µ–∑—Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç–Ω—ã–π" (unemployed), which was being used as a job title in HeadHunter API searches. This resulted in no matches.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Skip "–±–µ–∑—Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç–Ω—ã–π" as Job Title

```python
# backend/app/services/headhunter_service.py
if onboarding_profile.profession is not None:
    # Don't use "–±–µ–∑—Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç–Ω—ã–π" as a job title - use skills instead
    if onboarding_profile.profession.lower() not in ["–±–µ–∑—Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç–Ω—ã–π", "unemployed", "–±–µ–∑ —Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç—ã"]:
        preferences_data["preferred_job_titles"] = [onboarding_profile.profession]
```

### 2. Better Search Parameters Construction

-   If no job titles, use skills for search
-   Added fallback search for entry-level positions
-   Improved search term prioritization

### 3. Enhanced Debug Endpoints

-   Added detailed user search parameter testing
-   Enhanced skills debug information
-   Added direct HeadHunter API testing

## Debug Tools Created

### 1. Debug HTML Tool (`front/debug_vacancies.html`)

Navigate to: `http://REDACTED:3000/debug_vacancies.html`

This tool provides:

-   **Skills Debug**: Shows user's onboarding data and preferences
-   **User Search Test**: Tests the exact search parameters used for the user
-   **Recommendations Test**: Tests the full recommendation pipeline
-   **HeadHunter API Test**: Tests direct API access with common searches
-   **Full Diagnostic**: Runs all tests in sequence

### 2. Backend Debug Endpoints

#### `/api/jobs/debug/skills`

Shows detailed user information:

-   Onboarding completion status
-   Skills and preferences data
-   Recent recommendations
-   Search parameters that would be used

#### `/api/jobs/debug/test-search`

Tests the HeadHunter API with user's actual search parameters:

-   Shows exact parameters sent to HH API
-   Returns actual vacancy results
-   Helps identify if the issue is in search parameters or API response

## How to Use

### For Users Getting 0 Recommendations:

1. **Open the debug tool**: Navigate to `/debug_vacancies.html`
2. **Run Full Diagnostic**: Click the "üöÄ Run Full Diagnostic" button
3. **Check results**:
    - ‚úÖ Green sections indicate working components
    - ‚ùå Red sections indicate issues
    - üîç Focus on "User Search Test" results

### Common Issues and Solutions:

1. **No search terms generated**:

    - Check if user has skills in onboarding
    - Verify profession is not "–±–µ–∑—Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç–Ω—ã–π"
    - Solution: Re-run onboarding or manually set preferences

2. **HeadHunter API returns 0 results**:

    - Check if search terms are too specific
    - Verify area IDs are correct
    - Solution: Broaden search criteria

3. **Search parameters missing**:
    - Check if user preferences were created
    - Verify onboarding data was properly mapped
    - Solution: Force preference recreation

## Testing the Fix

After applying the fixes, test with the debug tool:

1. Clear any existing job preferences for the user
2. Run the "User Search Test" to see new search parameters
3. Check that skills are now used instead of "–±–µ–∑—Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç–Ω—ã–π"
4. Verify HeadHunter API returns results

## Expected Results

With the fixes, users with profession "–±–µ–∑—Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç–Ω—ã–π" should now:

1. Have their skills used for job searches instead of the profession
2. Get fallback searches for entry-level positions
3. Receive relevant job recommendations based on their actual skills

## Future Improvements

1. **Skill Synonyms**: Add better mapping between user skills and job search terms
2. **Experience Level**: Better handling of "no experience" users
3. **Location Flexibility**: Expand search to nearby cities if no local results
4. **Feedback Learning**: Improve recommendations based on user feedback

## Monitoring

Use these metrics to monitor recommendation effectiveness:

-   Percentage of users getting 0 recommendations
-   Average number of recommendations per user
-   User feedback on recommendation relevance
-   HeadHunter API response rates and errors
